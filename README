Readme file for programming information on the RFIDRW-E-TTL

To set up the serial port for use, the following has to be done:

	Disable Serial Port Login
		To enable the serial port for your own use you need to disable
		login on the port. There are two files that need to be edited:

		The first and main one is /etc/inittab

		This file has the command to enable the login prompt and this
		needs to be disabled. Edit the file and move to the end of the
		file. You will see a line similar to

		T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100

		Disable it by adding a # character to the beginning. Save the
		file.

		#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100
		
	Disable Bootup Messages to Serial Port
		When the Raspberry Pi boots up, all the bootup information is
		sent to the serial port. Disabling this bootup information is
		optional and you may want to leave this enabled as it is
		sometimes useful to see what is happening at bootup. If you have
		a device connected (i.e. Arduino) at bootup, it will receive
		this information over the serial port, so it is up to you to
		decide whether this is a problem or not.

		You can disable it by editing the file /boot/cmdline.txt

		The contents of the file look like this

		dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0, \
		115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 \
		elevator=deadline rootwait

		Remove all references to ttyAMA0 (which is the name of the
		serial port). The file will now look like this

		dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 \
		rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait
		
	Testing With Minicom
		A great way to test out the serial port is to use the minicom
		program. If you dont have this installed run:

		sudo apt-get install minicom

		Connect your PC to the Raspberry Pi serial port using an
		appropriate serial port adapter and wiring, then open Putty or a
		similar serial terminal program on PC side. Setup a connection
		using the serial port at 9600 baud.

		Now run up minicom on the Raspberry Pi using

		minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/ttyAMA0

Current status 1/16/15
This is the same day that I put power on the device, which I connected
yesterday afternoon. Using the above directions, I am able to
communicate with the reader, although I can't sense/read cards.  The
problem may be 1 of 2 things:
	1. 	The transponder card frequency is 125 kHz while the reader is
	 	running at 136.5 kHz. This can be fixed with an external capacitor.
	
	2. The card may be blank

Once I add the capacitor, i'll try the FDX-B/HDX protocol.  I also need
to study the exact communication sequence with the card.

I am able to read the card using the T55xx protocol. That makes sense,
the card is a T5567.  The data returns as all zeros.

The next step is to write the card.

Today when I first started the application and did a report firmware
version, it gave me a ?0 instead of 310.  Subsequent commands worked
fine.  There may be a need to have the Pi initialize the reader on power
up, or periodically.

Note:
Cards are T5567, which use the T55xx data set.  The data set is
structured as follows:

Page 0, block 0 - 32-bit configuration data
Page 0, block 1 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 2 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 3 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 4 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 5 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 6 - 32-bit r/w data
Page 0, block 7 - 32-bit r/w data, or password
Page 1, block 1 - 32-bit trace data
Page 1, block 2 - 32-bit trace data

Each block is decoded as 8 characters of ASCII data.

Need to handle the ?0 case (command not understood), ?1, and ?2.

After setting type of card (T55xx), using minicom I can pass cards by
and I will get new data each time a new card is read.  Need to define
exact requirements for card to auto read after powerup.
